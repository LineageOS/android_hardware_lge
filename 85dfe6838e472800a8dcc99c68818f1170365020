But that\u0027s using msm8998 and not msm8996.\n\nIt also completely rewrites what you guys had, but I feel as though this is the solution going forward; it fixes the issue of not needing to reboot audioserver anymore, and also if we could align all our implementations in a similar fashion I don\u0027t have to write a third version just for joan (and lge845/8150 which will need OSS audio soon:tm:).\n\nWould like some testing/feedback, since I don\u0027t have a V20 to verify any of this works.",
